Introduction to the WISE Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Project Theme Architecture

Each SCORE project theme is made up of a "vle_body.html" file, a "config.json" file, and
folders for custom CSS, images, Javascript, and navigation modes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use:

**** Theme HTML (vle_body.html) ****

The "vle_body.html" file provides the HTML specific to this theme. It will be inserted
into the WISE core 'vle.html' file when a project loads.

Edit "vle_body.html", the theme's CSS, and the images in the 'images' folder to
customize the WISE VLE styling and user interface to your liking.

Required and suggested elements in "vle_body.html" are marked as such. These elements are
necessary for core WISE features to function properly. Make sure to include these elements
somewhere in the "vle_body.html" file, but feel free to move them around and style them to
your liking unless otherwise noted.

(Note: Any required CSS and/or Javascript files for this theme should be specified in the
"config.json" file - see below).


**** Theme configuration (config.json) ****

The "config.json" file in this theme's root directory is responsible for setting the
theme's identifying information and configuration options.

To utilize any CSS or javascript files for your theme, you must specify their file paths
in the "config.json" file (see items 11 and 12 below) and include the corresponding files in
the theme package.

*NOTE*: WISE includes the jQuery (http://jquery.com) and jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com)
javascript libraries by default.  You do not need to include these files with your theme.
WISE also provides a default theme for jQuery UI. If you would like to use a customized 
jQuery UI theme instead of the WISE default, indicate the file path to your custom CSS file
in the configuration options (see item 13 below).  (You can also make minor modifications
to any jQuery UI styles using any of the CSS files you include with this theme.)

(For help creating your own jQuery UI themes, visit the jQuery UI ThemeRoller:
http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/).

If you are including a screenshot and/or thumbnail image for this theme, be sure to add the
corresponding image files to the theme package as well.  Note: screenshots/thumbnails will
be displayed in the project settings section of the WISE authoring tool where authors can
select a theme and corresponding navigation mode to use for each project.

The following fields should be included in the theme's "config.json" file.  Modify each field to
match your theme.

*Configuration Options*:
1. "id" - A unique identifier for this theme; MUST be the same as this theme's root folder
	name (String)
2. "name" -  A text identifier for the theme; will be displayed when selecting the
	theme in project authoring and/or run settings (String)
3. "description" - A short text description of the theme's major features (String)
4. "notes" - More detailed information about the theme and any special instructions or 
	requirements for using it, including project structure and/or content requirements and
	limitations (String; optional)
5. "version" - Version number for this iteration of the theme (String)
6. "author" - Name of the theme's author (String)
7. "date" - Date and time the theme was created/updated (String)
8. "screenshot" - Preview screenshot of theme (File path relative to theme root)
9. "thumb" - Preview thumbnail image of theme (File path relative to theme root),
10. "logo" - VLE logo for this theme; usually displayed in HTML for the project VLE - see
	"vle_logo" DOM element in "vle_body.html" (File path relative to theme root)
11. "css" - CSS files required by theme (Array of file paths relative to theme root)
12. "js" - Javascript files required by theme; Optional (Array of file paths relative to theme root)
13. "jqueryui_css" - CSS file for customized jQuery UI theme; Optional, as WISE provides a
	default jQuery UI theme; leave value as empty string ("") to use the default theme (File
	path relative to theme root)
14. "nav_modes" - The project navigation modes this theme supports; First entry in the array
	will be set as the default; Each navigation mode's 'id' entry MUST match the name of a folder
	in the "navigation" directory for your theme; You must include at least one navigation mode
	with your theme; See "Project Navigation" section below for more details (Array of Objects)


**** Project Navigation Menu ****

With each WISE VLE theme, authors can include any number of accompanying navigation modes.
Navigation modes define the visual appearance and behavior of the project navigation menu (i.e. the 
activity and step DOM elements that make up each SCORE project menu).

Available navigation modes for a theme are defined in the theme's "config.json" file, in the
"nav_modes" configuration option (item 13 above). Each navigation mode entry must be a JSON object
and should include the following items:
1. "id" - A unique identifier for this navigation mode; MUST match the name of a folder in the theme's
	"navigation" directory (String)
2. "name" - A text identifier for the navigation mode; will be displayed when selecting the
	navigation mode in project authoring and/or run settings (String)
3. "description" - A short text description of the navigation mode's layout/features (String)
4. "notes" - More detailed information about or instructions for using the navigation mode, including
	project structure and/or step type or content requirements (String; optional)
5. "screenshot" - Preview screenshot of theme (File path relative to theme root)
6. "stepIcons" - Setting indicating whether the navigation mode displays icons for steps in the project;
	authoring tool will show or hide step icons selectors depending on this option (Boolean)
7. "activityIcons" - Setting indicating whether the navigation mode displays icons for activities in the
	project; authoring tool will show or hide activity icons selectors depending on this option (Boolean)
8. "activityIconPath" - The default image file to use for activity icons (default step icons are
	specified by each step type) (File path relative to theme root; optional)
9. "css" - Extra CSS files required by the navigation mode (Array of file paths relative to theme root)
10. "js" - Extra Javascript files required by the navigation mode (Array of file paths relative to theme root)

*Every WISE VLE theme MUST include at least 1 (one) navigation mode.*

For each navigation mode, you must include a corresponding folder (with the same name as the 
navigation mode's "id" attribute) in the "navigation" directory which is located at the root level of 
the theme.

Each navigation mode folder must include the following:
1. "nav.js" file - This file specifies the HTML for navigation menu components (nodes and sequences), 
	defines the navigation menu toggle event, and also specifies any navigation events to register 
	with the VLE event dispatcher. REQUIRED items are noted as such in the sample "nav.js" files in this
	theme. Theme creators can also define customizations to add when both the navigation menu has been 
	created in the DOM and a when new step has been opened by a student, and can also add any other 
	custom events they would like. (See the "nav.js" files included with this theme's navigation modes 
	for more details.)
2. "nav.css" file - This file includes any navigation menu specific CSS and theme customizations.
3. Any other assets (images, Javascript, CSS, for example) that the navigation mode uses


**** Internationalization ****

The WISE VLE project theme architecture supports internationalized text (based on the WISE installation's
locale setting). If you would like to enable internationalization for your theme, ensure that the 
"i18n_enabled" setting in the theme's "config.json" file is set to true and that you include the "i18n" 
folder in your theme's root directory. The "i18n" folder must include an "i18n_[locale].json" file for 
each locale you want to support.

For each internationalized text/HTML item you would like to use in the DOM, add an entry to each of your 
"i18n_[locale].js" files. i18n items should be written in the following format:
	
	"key_value":{
		"value":"The text or html to insert",
		"description":"A short description of where this text is used"
	}
	
To insert i18n text into your theme's DOM, simply invoke the view's "getI18NString" function in any of the 
NavigationPanel.prototype functions in the "nav.js" files for your navigation modes in this manner: 
"this.view.getI18NString('key_value','theme')" (where "this" is the NavigationPanel prototype object). Be
sure to include the 'theme' parameter as the second argument of the getI18NString function call.

For example (using the sample i18n item above),

>> $('#sample_div').html(this.view.getI18NString("key_value","theme"));

will result in this HTML:

>> <div id="sample">The text or html to insert</div>

*See the included "i18n" folder and "nav.js" files included in this theme for examples.*
